# Image-Colorization
This Python code uses OpenCV and a pre-trained Caffe model to colorize a black-and-white or grayscale image. The process involves converting the image to the Lab color space, applying a deep learning model to predict the color channels, and then combining these predictions with the original image to produce a colorized version.
